> Think in wireframes. Ship in HTML/Figma.

## Mission

Make wireframes as easy to generate as prose.

## Axioms

1. **LLM-first** — Syntax optimized for machine generation, human tweaking.
2. **One way** — Each concept has exactly one representation.
3. **Explicit > implicit** — Named attributes, visible structure.
4. **Lo-fi by design** — Sketch aesthetic enforces focus on structure, not polish.
5. **Composition** — Elements nest cleanly via indentation.
6. **Sugar over primitives** — Domain keywords map to 3 primitives: `container`, `control`, `content`.
